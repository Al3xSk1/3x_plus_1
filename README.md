# 3x_plus_1
This is a cool Powershell Script that uses Python skript that creates a csv file that is made into a pdf graph with R. The current example number used is 7.

## How To Use

### Windows

run Run.ps1

If it doesn't work check the Run.ps1 file and edit the version of R or location of R. The reason it is done this way is because using the R command results in an alias for invoke-history being used

### Linux and MacOS

.sh File coming soon

run 3x_plus_1.py

Enter your number

run 3x_plus_1.R

Open rplot.pdf
